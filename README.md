# NEX-GL-Simulation
This repository contains the code and data structures for the computational process theory  presented in Bowker &amp; Kozlowski (under review): Unequal Structures and Uneven Returns: A Computational Process Theory of Gendered Leadership Emergence. 

The NEX-GL SImulation implements computational process theorizing to simulate how gendered disparities in leadership emerge through recursive and gendered social exchanges in organizational networks.

The file _NEX-GL Simulation.py_ contains the simulation script needed to implement all functions for agent initialization, interaction, and data collection. Results from the simulation runs for the paper can be found on OSF. 

System Requirements: Python version 3.12.8.
IDE: Visual Studio (recommended)
